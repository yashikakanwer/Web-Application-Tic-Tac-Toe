Task:  To build a tic-tac-toe web application

To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This sentence explains that to create a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, you can use three programming languages:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):  used for structuring and organizing content on the web.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):  used for styling and layout.

JavaScript:  used for adding interactivity and dynamic effects to the game.

By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. 
This sentence outlines the key functionalities required to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game:

Handle user clicks:  the game should respond to user input (e.g., clicking on a square).

Track game state:  the game should keep track of the current state of the board, including which squares are occupied and by whom.

Check for winning conditions:  the game should be able to determine when a player has won (i.e., got three of their symbols in a row).

With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
This sentence explains that the game can be designed to allow users to play against:

Each other: two human players can play against each other.

An AI opponent: a human player can play against a computer-controlled opponent (AI).

The ultimate goal of the game is to get three markers (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
